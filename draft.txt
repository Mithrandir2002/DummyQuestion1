need a ref to track the list (updated each time the list is modified)



prevCurr
current = head
while current != null
    count = 0
    dummy = head
    while dummy != null 
        current.value == dummy.value, count++
        dummy = dummy.next
    if count > 1
        if current == head
            head = current
            temp = current
            current = current.next
            prevCurr.next = current
            temp.next = null
        else
            temp = current
            current = current.next
            prevCurr.next = current
            temp.next = null
